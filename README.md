# Better AI Coding with Fireproof: `llms.txt`

Fireproof is an open-source JavaScript database that works locally and syncs effortlessly to the cloud‚Äîno backend setup required. By including `llms.txt` in your prompts, AI models gain a deep understanding of Fireproof's API, allowing them to generate fully functional applications without extra backend configuration dependencies. Use this txt file in your prompts, and may be surprised how often your prompts become "one shots that work." 

## üöÄ Why Use `llms.txt`?

AI-assisted development works best when the model understands the tools you're using. The `llms.txt` file enhances LLM-generated code by providing:  

- **Comprehensive API documentation** for Fireproof  
- **Best practices for data modeling** in a local-first environment  
- **Pre-built examples** to ensure AI-generated code is runnable out-of-the-box  

With this file, AI models can generate complete Fireproof-powered applications that work immediately‚Äîno backend, no SQL, just a simple, local JavaScript database.  

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üîπ With Any Other LLM  
1. Copy the contents of [`llms.txt`](https://use-fireproof.com/llms.txt).  
2. Paste it into your prompt before asking the model to generate code using Fireproof.  
3. Watch as the AI produces a compact, working application with built-in Fireproof integration.  

## üìú How `llms.txt` Works  

`llms.txt` acts as a structured reference, ensuring that LLMs understand how to interact with Fireproof databases effectively. It follows the `llms.txt` standard, which improves AI reasoning by providing essential documentation in a machine-readable format.  

### üìñ What is `llms.txt`?  

The `llms.txt` format was proposed by Jeremy Howard in 2024 as an AI-friendly documentation standard. Similar to `robots.txt` for search engines, `llms.txt` helps LLMs understand and utilize a project's API and best practices.
